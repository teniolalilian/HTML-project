    <h2>Nigerian Jollof rice</h2>
    <p >Jollof (/dʒəˈlɒf/), or jollof rice, is a rice dish from West Africa.
         The dish is typically made with long-grain rice, tomatoes, onions, spices,
          vegetables and meat in a single pot, although its ingredients and preparation
           methods vary across different regions.</p>
           <p>The African Jollof has a reputation not only for its seductive aroma, deep-red color,
             and spicy flavor, thanks to a diversified array of recipes; it is also the undisputed 
             queen of West African kitchens, with many countries laying claim to this culinary treasure.</p>

                <h2>Instructions</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Heat the cooking oil in a large pan. When the oil is hot, add the diced
                         onions and cook for about 3 to 5 minutes, or until the onions are soft.</li><br>
                    <li>Next, add the tomato paste and fry for about 5 minutes. Then add the garlic,
                         ginger, and bay leaves and let it cook in the tomato paste for about 2 minutes.</li><br>
                    <li>Add the blended pepper and allow the pepper to cook until the water is reduced entirely
                         and the oil is seen floating on the fried pepper—about 15 minutes.</li><br>
                    <li>Stir the rice into the sauce until it is well coated. Then add the chicken stock, stir,
                        and cover with a tight-fitting lid, and then bring to a boil over high heat. </li><br>
                    <li>Once it begins to boil—after about 3 to 5 minutes, reduce the heat immediately to
                         medium-low and steam until the rice is done—about 30 minutes.</li><br>
                    <li>Add the butter, sliced tomato, and onions, stir together briefly and turn off the heat.
                         Cover it immediately so that the heat remaining in the rice can steam up the vegetables a little.
                    </li><br>
                    <li>Serve with sweet fried plantains, roasted chicken, or salad.</li>
